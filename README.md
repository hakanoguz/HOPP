# Hakan's Optimal Path Program (HOPP)
This tool was written in 2008 with Visual Basic .NET by Hakan OGUZ. The main objective of this program is to find the optimal path between two points (starting and ending points) on a given raster imagery based on land use land cover (lulc) and slope raster imageries. Slope values are required to be percent. LULC image should have values 1 to 10 or accordingly where larger values represent areas that are more difficult to pass through.
